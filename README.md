Selenium JUnit is a popular test automation framework for testing web applications. JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java and Selenium JUnit is an integration of JUnit and Selenium WebDriver.

With Selenium JUnit, developers can write automated tests for web applications using Java programming language. These tests can validate the functionality of a web application, including the presence of specific elements, the behavior of buttons, links, and forms, and the responsiveness of the application to different types of inputs and interactions.

Using Selenium JUnit, developers can test the functionality of their web applications at the UI level and ensure that the applications are working as expected. This can improve the quality of the applications and help to catch bugs early in the development cycle.
